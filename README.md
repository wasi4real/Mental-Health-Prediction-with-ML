# Predicting-student-mental-health-using-machine-learning
This project focuses on the pressing issue of student mental health. Utilizing a dataset of 1977 student responses, this project employs three distinct machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and a Neural Network (MLP Classifier) to predict the presence and severity of these mental health challenges.
